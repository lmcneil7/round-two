            >You</pronoun>? <pronoun who="Weinburg">You</pronoun>, <char>Lt. Weinburg</char>?
            <pronoun who="Jessup">I</pronoun> have a greater <noun category="thing"
            >responsibility</noun> than <pronoun who="Weinburg">you</pronoun> could possibly fathom.
            <pronoun who="Weinburg">You</pronoun> weep for <char>Santiago</char>, and <pronoun

            who="Weinburg">You</pronoun> don’t want the truth because deep down in <noun

                <noun category="thing" con="reliability">loyalty</noun>.</simile>
        <pronoun who="Marines">We</pronoun> use these words as the backbone of a <noun

            >freedom</noun> that <pronoun who="Jessup">I</pronoun> provide, and then questions the
        manner in which <pronoun who="Jessup">I</pronoun> provide it. <pronoun who="Jessup"
            >I</pronoun> would rather <pronoun who="Weinburg">you</pronoun> just said thank <pronoun
            who="Weinburg">you</pronoun>, and went on <pronoun who="Weinburg">your</pronoun> way.
        Otherwise, <pronoun who="Jessup">I</pronoun> suggest <pronoun who="Weinburg">you</pronoun>
        pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, <pronoun who="Jessup">I</pronoun> don’t give
